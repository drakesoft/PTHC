Solder two 19-pin female headers in the designated positions. Then plug in the ESP32 module ‚Äì allowing easy replacement if needed.

---

### Step 10: One-Wire Bus for Temperature Sensor (Optional)

The one-wire bus lets you connect a digital temperature sensor.  
Solder R4 and SV4. SV4 is mounted on the bottom side of the board with the connector pins facing downward.

| Component | Value | Type           | Color Bands                          |

---

### Step 2: Varistor (Optional for Triac Control)

| Component | Value   | Type     |
|-----------|---------|----------|
| R3        | S10K11  | Varistor |

The varistor protects the circuit from overvoltage. It is non-polarized and can be installed in either direction.

---

### Step 3: Triac (Optional)

| Component | Value     | Type  | Notes                             |
|-----------|-----------|-------|-----------------------------------|
| T1        | T3035H-6T | Triac | If not installed, add a wire bridge |

If the triac is not used, replace it with a wire bridge.

---

### Step 4: Thermal Fuse (Important!)

| Component | Value | Notes                                        |
|-----------|-------|----------------------------------------------|
| TCO       | V0    | Keep the component cool while soldering!     |

‚ö†Ô∏è **Important:**  
The TCO must not get hot! Otherwise, the fuse may trigger. Solder quickly and, if needed, cool it with a damp cloth.

---

### Step 5: Solder Jumper SJ1 (Optional)

SJ1 is not a component but a solder jumper.  
It can be closed if no external contactor is used for disconnecting mains voltage.  
If an external contactor is used, connect the L1_C terminal to the L1 that is not switched by the contactor.

---

### Step 6: Install Relays

| Component | Type  |
|-----------|-------|
| K1‚ÄìK5     | G2RE  |

|-----------|------------------|--------------------|
| J1‚ÄìJ5     | HB9500-9.5-2P   | Ensure tight fit    |

---

### Step 9: Prepare Pin Headers

- The pin headers (SV1 and SV2) come as one long strip and must be broken apart:
  - 1x 4-pin (SV1)
  - 1x 8-pin (SV2)

Solder the prepared pin headers onto the board.

---

### Step 10: Mount the Control Board

- Carefully slide the "Control Board" onto the angled pin headers and solder them.  
  Ensure both PCBs are aligned at a proper 90¬∞ angle.

---

## Step 11: Final Check

- Visually inspect all solder joints.
- Confirm all components are properly seated.
- Ensure there are no shorts.


# Assembly and Installation Instructions

---

## Step 1: Prepare the ESP32 Module

Program the ESP32 module and ideally connect it to your Wi-Fi **before** installation.  
Once mounted, access to the module is limited.  
After programming, insert it into the prepared socket header.

---

## Step 2: Create Housing Cutouts

- Prepare the necessary openings in the enclosure.
- Possible sizes: 4x M12, 3x M16/20, 1x M25/32  
  ‚ö†Ô∏è Note: Not all openings can be used at the same time, as some may be blocked by the PCBs.
- For the switch option, an M12 opening is required.
- Install the cable glands.

---

## Step 3: Electrical Requirements

- Ground both the heating element and the boiler.
- Install an RCD and appropriate fuse, depending on the heating element's power (max. 25A).
- **Comply with all local regulations!**

### Wire Gauge Table for Supply Line (3-phase in installation conduit)

| Heating Power (kW) | Fuse (A) | Min. Cross-Section (mm¬≤) |
|--------------------|----------|---------------------------|
| 3                  | 6        | 1.5                       |
| 6                  | 10       | 1.5                       |
| 9                  | 16       | 2.5                       |
| 12                 | 20       | 2.5                       |
| 15                 | 25       | 4                         |

---

## Step 4: Heating Element Wiring

Remove all factory bridges from the heating element.  
A **7-core cable** is required for wiring.  
The protective earth (PE) must be connected according to regulations.

‚ö†Ô∏è **Important:**  
Cable temperature affects the required cross-section. Increase the size if environmental conditions demand it.

### Heating Element Wiring Table

| Power (kW) | Phase Current (A) | Line Current (A) | Min. Cross-Section (mm¬≤) |
|------------|-------------------|------------------|---------------------------|
| 3          | 4.3               | 2.5              | 1.0                       |
| 6          | 8.7               | 5.0              | 1.5                       |
| 9          | 13                | 7.5              | 1.5                       |
| 12         | 17.3              | 10               | 2.5                       |
| 15         | 21.7              | 12.5             | 4                         |

**Note:** The line current is ‚àö3 smaller than the phase current, so a smaller cross-section than the supply line may be sufficient.

---

## Step 5: Connect Heating Element

Use a multimeter to identify the three heating elements.  
Each has two terminals. The PCB labeling follows the format **Hx.y**,  
where **x** is the heating element number and **y** is the specific terminal.

Example: **H1.1** refers to heating element 1, terminal 1.  
The heating elements are equivalent, so you can assign the numbering as you like üòâ

---

## Step 6: Supply Line and Phase Rotation

Connect the supply line and check the correct phase rotation (e.g., with SM852B).  
‚ö†Ô∏è This is important: only phase **L1** is directly measured. The other phases are derived from it.  
If the rotation is incorrect, zero-cross detection will only work for L1.  
Relays will only switch at the zero-cross point **if rotation is correct**, which reduces contact wear significantly.

**Warning:**  
L2 and H3.2 are directly connected.  
Without an external contactor, L2 is always live at the heating element, even when switched off!  
Always disconnect power before working on the system.

If using an external contactor: connect **L1_C** to the non-switched L1 line.  
This ensures power supply for the control electronics.

## ‚úÖ Completion

Congratulations!  
Hopefully, everything works exactly as you intended üòä
