# PTHC - Power to Heat Controller

Welcome to the PTHC project! This open-source project is based on ESPHome and provides a control system for a three-phase heating element. The PTHC is designed to be efficient, compact, and user-friendly, making it an excellent choice for your heating control needs.

## Features

- 16 Power Levels: The PTHC supports 16 power levels providing flexible heating options to suit your needs.

- Support for three-phase heater 400V (380V) delta connection with upto 15kW (15000W) output power

- Zero-Cross Switching: The PTHC utilizes zero-cross switching technology, ensuring minimal electrical noise and extending the lifespan of the components.

- High Efficiency: The system boasts an impressive standby consumption of only 0.5W to 0.7W while connected to Wi-Fi, with operational losses capped at a maximum of 2W, making it an energy-efficient solution for heating control.

- Easy to Solder: All components are through-hole (THT), making assembly straightforward and accessible for hobbyists and DIY enthusiasts.

- Compact and Affordable: The design is compact, allowing for easy integration into various setups, and it is cost-effective, making it an attractive option for users.

- 1-Wire Bus for Temperature Sensors: The system supports a 1-Wire bus for connecting temperature sensors, enabling precise temperature monitoring and control.

- Expansion Ports: Additional ports are available for custom extensions, such as connecting an optical reading head from a power meter, allowing for further customization and functionality.

## Future Plans

In the future, we plan to implement optional wave packet control to provide even more power levels.
